<span style='font-size: 18px; margin: 0 5px;'> This Pet Project, but allows you to see the quality of the code that I use on real projects.</span>

<span style='font-size: 18px; margin: 0 5px;'>Since real projects cannot be attached to a portfolio:</span>

- <span style='font-size: 17px; margin: 0 5px;'>Customer restriction</span>
- <span style='font-size: 17px; margin: 0 5px;'>Communication with the backend, which also needs to be maintained, and this is the Full Stack</span>
- <span style='font-size: 17px; margin: 0 5px;'>Difficult to refactor</span>

<span style='font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700; margin: 0px;'> Therefore, in order to show the quality of the code, it was decided to use a small pet project, which will be periodically refactored with the advent of new knowledge and new experience.</span>

<span style='font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;'>I had an idea to write the same project using different technologies.</span>

<span style='font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;'>The question may arise, why is it the same?</span>

<span style='font-size: 16px; margin: 0px;'>Answer to the question:</span>

- <span style='font-size: 15px; margin: 0 5px;'> Ease of writing, using various stack technologies;</span>
- <span style='font-size: 15px; margin: 0 5px;'>Ease of refactoring;</span>
- <span style='font-size: 15px; margin: 0 5px;'>Visibility of technology differences;</span>
